Federal Reserve Signals Potential Rate Cuts in Mid-2024

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated Wednesday that the central
bank may begin cutting interest rates by mid-2024 if inflation continues
its downward trajectory.

Speaking at a post-FOMC press conference, Powell stated that recent data
shows "meaningful progress" toward the Fed's 2% inflation target. The
Committee voted unanimously to hold rates steady at 5.25%-5.50% for the
third consecutive meeting.

Powell emphasized that policy decisions remain data-dependent, noting that
the Fed will monitor inflation trends, labor market conditions, and economic
growth before making any moves.

Markets rallied on the dovish tone, with the S&P 500 gaining 1.4% and the
10-year Treasury yield falling to 4.15%. Fed funds futures now price in
three quarter-point rate cuts by year-end 2024.

Economists at JPMorgan expect the first cut to come in June 2024, while
Morgan Stanley forecasts a March start to the easing cycle.
